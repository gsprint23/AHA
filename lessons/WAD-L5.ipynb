    "## Data Aggregation Overview\n",
    "Gathering and summarizing information, perhaps in preparation for statistical analysis or visualization, is called *data aggregation*. For example, suppose you want to investigate the similarities/differences amongst patients in a clinical setting. Suppose specific attributes you are interested in include medical condition, age, and gender. You might *group* the data into two groups: male and female. By grouping the data based on a variable, such as gender, you are aggregating the data. The grouping allows you to then create a bar chart representing the frequency of each medical condition present in each group, or perform hypothesis testing to see if there is a significant age difference between the two groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Split-Apply-Combine\n",
    "Data aggregation typically follows a \"split, apply, combine\" process:\n",
    "* Split the data into groups based on some criteria\n",
    "    * Perform *group by* operations\n",
    "    * Select or slice data to form a subset\n",
    "    * Example: Group a data frame by rows (axis 0) or by columns (axis 1)\n",
    "* Apply a function to each group independently, producing a new value\n",
    "    * Compute summary statistics (aggregation)\n",
    "        * Example: Count the size of each group\n",
    "        * Example: Compute mean, standard deviation, custom stats, etc.\n",
    "    * Transform the data in the group (transformation)\n",
    "        * Example: Standardizing data (z-score) within each group\n",
    "        * Example: Filling missing data with a value derived from each group\n",
    "    * Discard some groups (filtration)\n",
    "        * Example: Discarding data that belongs to groups with only a few members\n",
    "        * Example: Filtering out data based on the group sum or mean\n",
    "* Combine the results of the function applications into a data structure\n",
    "    * Example: A series with index corresponding to data frame column names and values representing the column means\n",

    "In the split step, we want to divide a dataset into a mapping of group names to group data. With the Pandas [`groupby()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) function, we can divide a data frame into a [`GroupBy`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html) object that stores the mapping.
