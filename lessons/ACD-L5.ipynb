    "In the previous lessons, we learned how to download time series data from the Fitbit API and how to visualize the time series data. For the example Fitbit data in [fitbit_example_data.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/aha/master/lessons/files/fitbit_example_data.zip), we created an ADM that looked like the following:\n",

    "Visual inspection of this ADM tells us quite a bit about the activity patterns for this individual. He/she usually sleeps from 1AM-8AM, is fairly sedentary during the week, and goes out for exercise on the weekends from 12PM-5PM. Visual inspection is useful for [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) (EDA). Beyond the EDA stage of analyzing this dataset, we want to write an algorithm to *quantify* the change between two different windows of time. For example, if we could quantify the daily change from weekday to weekday, or weekend to weekend, we could potentially flag certain daily routines as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\", depending on the value of the detected change. \n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example is a special case of a general problem called change detection and analysis. In [Sprint et al., 2016](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046416300740), we address this problem with our Physical Activity Change Detection (PACD) approach. PACD is a framework that determines if a significant change exists between two windows of time series step data (data which indicates the number of steps taken by an individual over a period of time) sampled from a physical activity sensor, such as a Fitbit. PACD is comprised of four main steps:\n",
    "1. Segments time series data into windows\n",
    "2. Detects changes between time windows\n",
    "3. Determines significance of the detected changes\n",
    "4. Analyzes the nature of the significant changes.\n",

The index of this data frame is a minute by minute `DateTimeIndex` and the columns are daily step data. Here is a sample of the format of the data:\n",

    "To perform segmentation, consider the above data frame example. Let $D = \\{x_{1}, x_{2},..., x_{t},..., x_{m}\\}$ represent one column of time series step data for one day, where $x_{t}$ is a scalar number of steps taken at time interval $t = 1, 2, ..., m$ and $m$ is the number of equal-sized time intervals in a day. Let $t_{mins}$ denote the number of minutes per time interval, $t$. For the above example, $t_{mins} = 1$ minute and $m = 1440$ minutes / $t_{mins}$ = 1440 intervals; however, if we re-sample the data, say hourly, then $t_{mins} = 60$ minutes and $m = 1440$ minutes / $t_{mins}$ = 24 intervals. $N$ days $D$ (columns) together represents a time series data set $X$ (data frame) of $N$ days, $D_{1}, ..., D_{N}$. Now, let $W$ be a window of $n$ days such that $W \\subseteq X$. You can think of $W$ as a slice of $X$ along the date (column) axis.\n",

    "We can compare windows of data within time series data $X$. These windows may represent consecutive times (e.g., days, weeks, months), a baseline window (e.g., the first week) with each subsequent time window, or overlapping windows. Let $W_{i}$ denote a window starting at day number $i$ of $X$ ($i \\geq 1$) such that $W_{i} = X[i: i + n - 1] = \\{D_{i}, D_{i+1},..., D_{i+n-1}\\}$. Suppose we have two windows of data, $W_{i}$ and $W_{j}$ ($i \\leq j$). Windows $W_{i}$ and $W_{j}$ can be formed as subsets of $X$ based on the initial value of $i$ and a parameter $\\mathit{offset}$ that determines the initial value of $j$ ($j$ = $i + \\mathit{offset}$). \n",

    "### Change Analysis\n",
    "If a change significance test concludes a change score is significant, the next step is to determine the source of change. Often this step requires the computation of features that summarize the data and provide a meaningful context for change. For example, the number of daily steps taken is an example of a simple PA feature. The change between daily steps from one window of time to the next can be quantified and used for an explanation of change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches exist to capture change across time in individual metrics. A straightforward method is to compute the percent change for a feature $f$ from a previous window $W_{i}$ to a current window $W_{j}$: $\\Delta\\%=({f_{W_{j}}-f_{W_{i}}})/f_{W_{i}}$. Statistical approaches such as two sample tests or effect size analyses can also be applied to quantify change; however, in applying repeated statistical tests, the multiple testing problem should be accounted for with a method such as the Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of the VC approach over other change point detection algorithms is it includes an explanation of the source of change without reliance on statistical tests. Upon significant change detection, retraining a classifier on the entire dataset and inspecting the model reveals which features are most discriminatory in learning the differences between two windows. Naturally, this approach requires a pre-processing step to extract relevant features from the windowed PA time series data."
