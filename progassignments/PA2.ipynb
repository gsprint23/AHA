    "## Overview and Requirements\n",
    "For this programming assignment, we are going to take a look at a real-world example of clinical data that needs cleaning and contains interesting insights once aggregated and visualized. For the purposes of working with data and practicing with Pandas and Matplotlib, we are going to work with this data in the following ways:\n",
    "1. Load the data \n",
    "1. Clean the data\n",
    "1. Aggregate the data\n",
    "1. Compute summary statistics from the data\n",
    "1. Plot the data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Details\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "Download the [patient_data_to_clean.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/aha/master/progassignments/files/patient_data_to_clean.csv) dataset. This dataset contains gender, marital status, and rehabilitation impairment category (RIC) information from 4,555 inpatient rehabilitation patients. The data has been de-identified and randomized. Here is a sample of the format of the data in the csv file:\n",
    "\n",
    "|ID|Gender|Age|Marital Status|RIC|Admission Total FIM Score|Discharge Total FIM Score|\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|0|M|80|Widowed|8|40|89|\n",
    "|1|M|90|Divorced|1|65|75|\n",
    "|2|M|53|Married|2|67|99|\n",
    "|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|\n",
    "\n",
    "And a description of each column:\n",
    "* ID (integer): Index of the dataset. Counting numbers starting at 0.\n",
    "* Gender (string): Gender of the patient, \"M\" for male and \"F\" for female.\n",
    "* Age (integer): Age of the patient in years\n",
    "* Marital Status (string): Description of the patient's marital status. No coding system enforced.\n",
    "* RIC (integer): RIC of the patient assigned according to Appendix B in the [Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services IRF-PAI training manual](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-fee-for-service-payment/inpatientrehabfacpps/downloads/irfpai-manual-2012.pdf).\n",
    "* Admission Total FIM Score: The admission total Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score of the patient. \n",
    "    * The FIM is a clinical assessment used to measure patient functioning at inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. The FIM is measured at two distinct points in time: admission and discharge. \n",
    "    * The FIM measures the level of assistance required to perform 18 ADL tasks. \n",
    "    * The tasks are categorized as either motor (13 tasks) or cognitive (5 tasks). Each task is scored on a 7-point ordinal scale to measure independence as determined by the amount of assistance required to perform each ADL task. \n",
    "    * For more information about the FIM, see Section III in the [Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services IRF-PAI training manual](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/medicare-fee-for-service-payment/inpatientrehabfacpps/downloads/irfpai-manual-2012.pdf).\n",
    "* Discharge Total FIM Score: The discharge total FIM score of the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Storage\n",
    "Read the patient data into a `pandas` `DataFrame` object. The index column is 0, which is the location of the ID column. The header row is the first row in the file."

    "* ID: No cleaning necessary\n",
    "* Gender: Transform this data so it is a Boolean data type, 1 for male and 0 for female. Rename the column from \"Gender\" to \"Is Male\" to provide the information necessary to know what 1 and 0 represents in the column. \n",
    "* Age: No cleaning necessary\n",
    "* Marital Status: Update this data so it adheres to a strict coding system instead free response. This column is quite messy compared to the other columns. If we only look at the first 8 rows of the dataset, the Marital Status column looks like it is well coded; however, we see for ID 8 there is a period after \"Married.\" which doesn't match any of the previous \"Married\" entries. Upon further exploration, we see this column truly was free response for the clinicians to enter text. For example, take a look at IDs 33, 36, 38, 41, and 42! We are going to after do some string matching to apply a uniform encoding for the Marital Status column. When cleaning this column, use a simple rule based system to handle the various spellings and word choices that represent the following marital statuses:\n",

    "    * Married\n",
