    "### AHA-DS\n",
    "We are going to implement a simple, daily change score algorithm that we are going to call *AHA-DS*! AHA-DS computes a change score based on dissimilarity between daily feature vectors. To describe the AHA-DS in detail, consider two days of Fitbit data, $D_{i}$ and $D_{j}$, each containing 1 day of step data. Feature vectors $F_{i}$ and $F_{j}$ represent the feature vectors for days $D_{i}$ and $D_{j}$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare two days $D_{i}$ and $D_{j}$ for changes, a weighted normalized Euclidean distance (WNED) measure is used as a change score to quantify the differences between the corresponding feature vectors $F_{i}$ and $F_{j}$. The smaller the Euclidean distance between these two vectors, the more similar the two days of data are. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let the number of features in feature vectors $F_{i}$ and $F_{j}$ be $d$. First, each feature is normalizes as follows (from [Wang et al., 2012](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6189784/?section=abstract)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{i}^{*}(k) = \\frac{F_{i}(k)}{max\\lbrack F_{i}(k), F_{j}(k) \\rbrack}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{j}^{*}(k) = \\frac{F_{j}(k)}{max\\lbrack F_{i}(k), F_{j}(k) \\rbrack}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $k = 1, ..., d$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the WNED between $F_{i}^{*}$ and $F_{j}^{*}$, $d_{ij}$, is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{ij} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\frac{1}{d} \\lbrack F_{i}^{*}(k) - F_{j}^{*}(k) \\rbrack^{2}}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Modes\n",
    "AHA-DS can compute a sequence of WNED change scores in two different comparison modes:\n",
    "1. Baseline day comparison: the first day in the dataset is a reference day and is used in each comparison, including a comparison to itself. All subsequent days are compared to the baseline day. For example:\n",
    "    1. First comparison: days (1, 1)\n",
    "    1. Second comparison: days (1, 2)\n",
    "    1. ...\n",
    "    1. Last comparison: days (1, $N$)\n",
    "1. Sliding day comparison: pairs of days are compared starting with the first two days. Subsequent pairs are the result of advancing by one day. For example:\n",
    "    1. First comparison: days (1, 2)\n",
    "    1. Second comparison: days (2, 3)\n",
    "    1. ...\n",

There are some days where it appears the Fitbit was not worn, perhaps it was charging or forgotten. For these days, the AHA-DS change score is quite high.
